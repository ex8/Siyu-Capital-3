# Siyu Capital
A very simple newsletter site written to better enhance my JavaScript skills, more specifically in Express and Node. You can add writers, newsletters, and comments. There is also a mini dashboard.

### Usage
Clone it. Then run `npm install` to get the dependencies. You can then run `npm start` to run nodemon and the express app.

You can look in the /routes/ directory to look at the API endpoints used for CRUD operations.

### Technologies used:
- Node.js
- Express.js (backend web framework)
- Jade (HTML template engine)
- Bulma (CSS framework)
- MongoDB (document database)
- nodemon (live web server)
