                    p At Siyu Capital Insights, we digest the most pressing
                        | and pertinent trends in the equity, bond, and derivatives
                        | markets for you. Our weekly brief is geared at those who
                        | are trying to deepen their understanding of and broaden
                        | their interest in the world of investing and finance.
                        | Insights are intended to develop a more comprehensive
                        | investment view while underpinning sound personal finance
                        | learning as well.

                    p Our inspiration to write stems from daily engagement in
                        | the investment space across the asset classes delineated
                        | above. We take a granular, often esoteric look at specific
                        | challenges in markets, but also keep an overall
                        | macroeconomic sentiment at the core of our value proposition.
                    br
                    p No portion of any writing either within the weekly brief or on
                        | this website itself will ever take the form of actionable financial
                        | advice. We are not certified financial planners, chartered financial
                        | analysts, or chartered market technicians (although weâ€™re
                        | working on it). Go Bruins.
